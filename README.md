# Terraform State Locking

This repository provides an implementation and infrastructure configuration for managing state locking in Terraform, ensuring safe and concurrent operations in multi-user environments.

## Overview

Terraform state locking is a mechanism that prevents simultaneous state modifications, helping teams avoid race conditions and potential state corruption. This project demonstrates how to set up and manage state locking using best practices in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

## Repository Structure

- `infra-for-state-locking/`: Contains Terraform configuration files to provision infrastructure resources required for state locking (e.g., backend storage, DynamoDB tables for locks).
- `state-locking/`: Example modules and usage patterns to implement and utilize state locking in your Terraform workflows.

## Features

- **Secure State Management:** Ensures only one operation can modify the state at a time.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Configurations suitable for production-grade deployments.
- **Modular Design:** Easily integrate state locking into existing Terraform projects.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitkumar0128/terraform-state-locking.git
   cd terraform-state-locking
   ```

2. Navigate to the infrastructure directory:
   ```bash
   cd infra-for-state-locking
   ```

3. Initialize and apply Terraform to provision required resources:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

4. Use the provided modules in `state-locking/` to configure your backend and enable state locking.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) v1.0 or above
- AWS credentials (if deploying AWS-based locking infrastructure)
- Appropriate IAM permissions for creating backend resources
